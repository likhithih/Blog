# Blog Management Implementation Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current Blog.jsx is minimal, only displays "Blog" text
- Backend has getBlogs endpoint at GET /blogs that returns all blogs sorted by createdAt desc
- Blog model includes: title, category, description, author, comments, image, createdAt
- Users.jsx provides a comprehensive UI template with grid/table views, search, pagination, modals, dark mode, etc.
- Authentication required for delete/update operations (middleware: authenticate)
- Backend runs on localhost:4000

## Plan
- [ ] Implement blog fetching with useEffect and axios
- [ ] Add state management for blogs, loading, error, search, pagination, view mode
- [ ] Create grid view for blogs with cards showing title, category, author, date, image
- [ ] Create table view for blogs with sortable columns
- [ ] Add search functionality for title and category
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create blog details modal
- [ ] Add delete functionality with authentication
- [ ] Add edit functionality (update blog)
- [ ] Handle image display from backend uploads

## Dependent Files
- E-Blog_front/src/Admin/Blog.jsx (main file to update)
- Backend endpoints: GET /blogs, DELETE /blogs/:id, PUT /blogs/:id

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test blog fetching and display
- [ ] Test search and pagination
- [ ] Test delete functionality
- [ ] Test edit functionality
- [ ] Ensure responsive design
