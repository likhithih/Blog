# TODO: Set Background Image for Login Page

- [x] Remove margins from elements in the login form and ensure box-sizing is set to border-box for the login page.
- [ ] Add a sign-up option to the login form (link to /signup).
- [ ] Add animation to the login form for smooth entrance.
- [ ] Ensure the background image takes full space without gaps.
